* complete user profile apis including addresses (crud)

TODOs
# apply isAdmin middleware to admin only actions
# create all validations with express-validators instead of middlewares
# on frontend, redirect to pages if condition is not fulfilled.
# cloudinary uploads
# ✅ create an api endpoint to clear the out of stock items from the cart. so that when checkout is hit, this api is called.
# in the order schema, don't use reference ids, add the actual data (bcoz that might be deleted)
# ✅ try giving display id to size schema so that _id is unique (solved without it)
# qty validation is needed in update and others (out of stock)
# ✅ updateCart is not working properly while changing size
# add returnable field in add product page.
# ✅ Cart Panel has only one function, to update the cart via dispatch (then send to checkout)
# ❗use controller instead of register to make use of the defaultValue.
# ✅ when user creates an account, also create a cart with empty array (done by fetchCart)
# ✅ add the user id in cart collection not the other way
# in the cart panel, let the user select any size, and then show if that size is out of stock.
# ✅ for now, quantity in details page and cart panel is decided by the or of const and if the stock is less than const
# ✅ set the total Item and subtotal in cart with the state from react-hook-form
# if user is not logged in, set the cart in localStorage, then if the user logs in, transfer the data to database.
# add a flag field on product, so that it appears on the product card (new, latest etc.)
# add a featured checkbox on product listing
# there should be atleast one collection : new arrivals
# ✅ add custom fields in specifications
# while updating a product, don't delete the images from directory, just remove their path from db.
# pagination on admin side (products, users, categories etc.)


// backend 
# use virtuals to set the cart total value and user fullname
# create such a model for orders that even single items can be cancelled or replaced.
# 

middlewares
# validateProductDB : kya product exist karta hai
# validateSizeDB : kya ye size ek particular product ki hi hai
# validateUserDB : kya ye user exist karta hai

// Things learnt
# when using ecma script to use import statements, giving extensions is necessary
# while using multer, the filename property of req.file gives that name which we have assigned
# in multer, cb is a callback that takes 2 params, first is the error object and second is the value sent back to multer, if the second param is boolean, it means whether to accept a file or not.
# I am unable to handle specific errors in multer as by default the cb returns res.send whereas I wanted res.json. also if I try to upload a large file of different mimetype, the request keeps on pending and eventually fails.
# multipart/mixed is depricated
# in mongodb query,  nested queries like : "items.qty" and "items.pid" will not ensure "AND" on the specific object of items but on the document it will. (use $elemMatch)
# to stop the validation chain for further fields evaluation, use .bail({level:'request'}), default is level:"chain" which evaluates every field
